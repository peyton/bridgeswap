# Bridgeswap V1 Frontend

## Getting Started

First, follow the local development instructions in the [Bridgeswap Contract README](../bridgeswap-contract/README.md) to run Vite locally and deploy the Bridgeswap smart contract with `yarn stakeContract`.

As this Dapp uses ViteConnect for authentication, you'll need to tell the Vite app to talk to your local Vite node. This step will vary based on your network configuration.

Once your Vite app is connected to your local node, you'll need a wallet. Configure your Vite app with the following mnemonic:
```
turtle siren orchard alpha indoor indicate wasp such waste hurt patient correct true firm goose elegant thunder torch hurt shield taste under basket burger
```

Finally, run

```bash
yarn dev
```
